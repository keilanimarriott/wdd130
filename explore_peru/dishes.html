                <p>Peru is a multiple-year award-winner when it comes to traditional foods. Many of these dishes have been passed down for generations; Peruvians are very strict when it comes to sticking with the original recipe! Here are some of the best food you should not miss.</p>

                <h2>Pollo a la Brasa</h2>
                <p>If one country in the world knows how to cook rotisserie chicken, it is Peru. The chicken is seasoned to perfection, and slowly roasted over coals until it is served fresh to you. There are many restaurants that specifically sell pollo a la brasa, as it is such a famous dish. In my opinion, the best chicken restaurant in the world is a small business around the corner from La Plaza de Armas in Arequipa, a place called Pio Pio. There, you are served chicken foot soup as an appetizer, until you are brought the delicious chicken served with french fries. Your hands will get messy while eating this chicken, but Pio Pio provides bowls of lemon water to more easily rinse your hands. Overall, this will be the best chicken of your life!</p>

                <h3>Aji de Gallina</h3>
                <p>Aji is a famous sauce made with the yellow chili pepper that Peruvians use to dip their french fries, chicken, and really anything. Aji de gallina, however, is a thicker chicken sauce that could be compared to cream of chicken soup, and it is served over rice with half a hard-boiled egg on top. Aji de gallina is not an easy meal to make, but it is one of the most popular and tastiest Peruvian dishes, leaving your stomach filled and happy!</p>

                <h4>Anticuchos</h4>
                <p>Anticuchos is a popular street food served on street corners. It is slices of cow heart stuck on a skewer, grilled and seasoned, and served with a small potato (usually purple or red) at the top of the skewer, You can hang around the anticuchos stand to dip it in aji and enjoy the greatest street food in the world! Many people may be intimidated or grossed out when they hear “cow heart”. However, my little sister, the pickiest eater alive, had the courage to take a bite. It is now her favorite food in the world.</p>

                <h5>Picarones</h5>
                <p>If you are more into sweet desserts, picarones is a popular street treat. Their cooking process is comparable to doughnuts, except these are made from potatoes or squash. They are formed and fried into rings, where you can take them and dip them in a syrupy molasses glaze. They make for a delicious dessert when you’re out on the street!</p>
