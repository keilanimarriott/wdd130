                <h2>Plaza de Armas, Arequipa, Peru</h2>
                <p>Arequipa is a special place to me; it is the city I lived in with my family.
                    Arequipa has much to offer, from its vast city life, to its farmland on the outskirts of town, to
                    the view of three beautiful volcanoes surrounding the city. The town center contains Arequipa’s best
                    site: La Plaza de Armas. The plaza is a large square with fountains, plant life, musicians, artists,
                    and is the home to most large city events such as parades or holiday celebrations. The square is
                    surrounded by shops and restaurants that stretch into the streets around it. The main centerpiece of
                    this plaza is the large catholic cathedral. This cathedral is an entire block long, with steeples
                    stretching to the sky. It was made with the white volcanic ash rock from the volcano Misti, which
                    can be seen towering directly behind this impressive cathedral. Tours of the cathedral are offered,
                    and inside you will see a grand and intricate chapel, with a large pipe organ and statues of the
                    saints. The tour takes you upstairs where you learn some history and see the historical ceremonial
                    clothing that is no longer used. You are also taken to the very top, into the bell tower, where you
                    are able to stand inside the enormous bell perched in one of the steeples. La Plaza de Armas is
                    truly a location you cannot miss.</p>

                <h2>Corire, Peru</h2>
                <p>If you are more into the quiet life and want to see a place with very little tourism where you can
                    experience a more humble view of life in Peru, Corire is a great place to visit. Set in the middle
                    of nowhere in the middle of a large valley, this little farm town is home to farmers and herders.
                    People are very welcoming there, and if you’re looking to experience a little bit of how they live,
                    people are always looking for help on the farms. From rice fields to potato farms to pig stables,
                    they have an abundance of food production and farm land. The cliffs towering over the valley are
                    also a beautiful sight to see, and a powerful river also flows through town. Also located in the
                    valley is the town of Arica, which has some great meat and fish shops. The quiet and humble town
                    life with beautiful scenery makes Corire a great location to travel to.</p>

            <section class="lost">
                <h2>The Lost City of Machu Picchu</h2>
                <p>We all knew this one would be on the list. Machu Picchu is what is known as “The Lost City of the
                    Inca”, and it’s a very fitting name. This ancient city is high in the mountains in the middle of the
                    jungle, making it very difficult to get there. The bus ride up to the city is steep and the roads
                    are windy and sharp. As you walk around the vast city it becomes more and more of a mystery how the
                    Incas managed to build it way up where it is placed, and how they brought all those stones up high
                    in the mountains. The city is vast, with countless homes and step-farms. There are multiple temples
                    spread throughout the city as well, including the Temple of the Sun. Llamas roam around, and may
                    approach you. Machu Picchu is a great educational, historical, and fun experience for all to enjoy;
                    just know that it will be an all-day trip with lots of walking! Fun fact: the mountain you typically
                    see in the city of Machu Picchu photos is not actually the mountain of Machu Picchu. Machu Picchu is
                    directly behind where the camera faces; the mountain seen in the famous photos is Huayna Picchu,
                    which means “resting mountain” or “young mountain”. Machu Picchu means “large mountain” or “old
                    mountain”.</p>

            <h2 id="tips">Tips & Tricks</h2>
            <section class="row1">
                <p>* A tip straight from the local farmers: when visiting Corire, you may notice that the
                    mosquitoes are
                    visious there. They are so small you don’t see them coming, yet they leave huge, painful marks on
                    your skin. However, the farmers of the town have found a way around that: lotion. They stay away
                    from bug spray; it doesn’t do anything! But if you wear lotion with long sleeves and long pants, the
                    mosquitoes drown in the lotion, keeping you bug resistant.</p>
                <p>
                    * If you are traveling around Peru, you will use taxis to get around. A good rule of thumb is to
                    look
                    for taxis that are marked with the company logo, and stay away from unmarked taxis. Once you call a
                    taxi, and they state their price, if you feel it is unfair, you can negotiate. You can negotiate
                    prices almost everywhere, and especially with taxis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    * Peruvian culture is very different from USA culture. For example, when greeting someone, instead
                    of just a handshake or a nod, it is common practice to give a kiss on the cheek. This is how you
                    always greet people after meeting them once. And when walking into a party with many people, you
                    must greet each person individually, according to cultural practices.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="row2">
                <p>
                    * Peruvian cities typically have very busy streets, and therefore you may encounter
                    pick-pocketers. A
                    good system we landed on was to keep all of our most valuable items, such as ID's, passports,
                    wallets, etc. in a thin fanny pack that can fit under your clothing where it will not be visible. It
                    keeps all your most valuable items safe and unseen while you're walking down the street.
                </p>
                <p>
                    * If you ever have an upset stomach or start getting altitude sickness, Peruvians drink Coca Cola
                    or
                    eat coca candy to help. Coca Cola is made a little differently in Peru, and it can calm an upset
                    stomach and even kill some bacteria (if you ate some bad food). Candy made from the coca leaf is
                    illegal in the united states (due to the plant being used to make drugs), but it is put to good use
                    in Peru. It calms altitude sickness very efficiently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    * When served food, it is impolite to leave it unfinished. Not finishing a meal tells the cook that
                    you did not enjoy her food. However, this could be quite difficult, considering the typical lunch
                    meal (lunch is the big family meal in Peru) is a huge bowl of soup too big to eat, followed by the
                    main course consisting of a plate stuffed with carbs. Prepare yourself!
