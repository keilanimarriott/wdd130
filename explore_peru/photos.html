                        Corire. This donkey was alive and still old when my dad was serving his mission over 20 years
                        ago!

                        A couple years ago we took a beautiful hike through the jungle, bending through the valley below
                        Machu Picchu. These are what most of the cliffs looked like, and you can see the river running
                        next to them.

                        Lima has many impressive things to see, one of which is one of the largest water fountain parks
                        in the world, Parque de la Reserva. There are many beautifully shaped and colored fountains.
                        Here is my family standing in front of the color-changing display fountain.

                        This is my family in the Plaza de Armas in Lima as we were in the process of moving to Peru. We
                        stayed in Lima for a few days before we moved to Arequipa. I was only 11 years old.

                        This is a market that we went to quite a bit and was a popular downtown grocery. All the meat,
                        fruit, and more was out in the open air, many butchers actually chopping right in the market
                        place. Everything was very fresh!
