    <h2>"Nani"</h2>
    <p>Hello, I am Keilani and I'm from Whidbey Island, WA. I'm a physics
      major and I'm just taking this class to learn more about coding and
      computers. Some things I like to do are backpacking, playing ultimate
      frisbee, coding with python, traveling, and playing the French horn.</p>
    <p>My family and I once lived in Peru for two years. It was a great 
      experience and I learned Spanish, learned the culture, went to middle
      school all in Spanish, and met some amazing people. I'm very grateful
      for that experience we had.</p>
    <p>I'm 20 years old and I have three younger siblings at home. 
      Pictured above is me with my dog Tucker (he's my favorite thing in 
      the world). I'm looking forward to this course because I know 
      nothing about web development and I already enjoy coding so it 
      would be great to know a little more about that.</p>
